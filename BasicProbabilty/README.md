Introduction:

Probability and Statistics are branches of mathematics concerned with data analysis, interpretation, and prediction. Probability measures the likelihood of an event, while statistics involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

Probability Basics:

★Experiment: A process or action that results in one or several outcomes.

★Sample Space (S): The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

★Event: A subset of the sample space, one or more outcomes of interest.

★Probability (P): A measure of how likely an event is to occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).

Types of Events:

★Independent Events: Occurrence of one event does not affect the other.

★Dependent Events: Occurrence of one event affects the probability of the other.

★Mutually Exclusive Events: Two events that cannot occur at the same time.

★Complementary Events: The event that an event does not occur.
