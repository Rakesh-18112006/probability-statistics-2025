## **Introduction**

Probability and Statistics are branches of mathematics concerned with data analysis, interpretation, and prediction. Probability measures the likelihood of an event, while statistics involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

### Probability and Statistics Overview

* **Probability:** The branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true.
* **Statistics:** The discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.

## **Probability Basics**

<a id="experiment"></a>
### Experiment

* **Definition:** A process or action that results in one or several outcomes.

<a id="sample-space-s"></a>
### Sample Space (S)

* **Definition:** The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

<a id="event"></a>
### Event

* **Definition:** A subset of the sample space, one or more outcomes of interest.

<a id="probability-p"></a>
### Probability (P)

* **Definition:** A measure of how likely an event is to occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).

---

## **Types of Events**

<a id="independent-events"></a>
### Independent Events

* **Definition:** Occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other.

<a id="dependent-events"></a>
### Dependent Events

* **Definition:** Occurrence of one event affects the probability of the other.

<a id="mutually-exclusive-events"></a>
### Mutually Exclusive Events

* **Definition:** Two events that cannot occur at the same time. Also known as disjoint events.

<a id="complementary-events"></a>
### Complementary Events

* **Definition:** The event that an event does not occur. If A is an event, its complement (A') is the event that A does not happen.

---

## **Random Variables**

<a id="definition-of-random-variable"></a>
### Definition of Random Variable

* **Definition:** A variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. It can be discrete (countable values) or continuous (values within a range).

---

## **Distributions**

<a id="definition-of-distribution"></a>
### Definition of Distribution

* **Definition:** A function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur. Common types include normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions.

---

## **Descriptive Statistics**

<a id="definition-of-descriptive-statistics"></a>
### Definition of Descriptive Statistics

* **Definition:** Methods used to describe or summarize data in a meaningful way, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation).

---

## **Inferential Statistics**

<a id="definition-of-inferential-statistics"></a>
### Definition of Inferential Statistics

* **Definition:** Methods used to draw conclusions or make predictions about a population based on a sample of data. This involves hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.

---

## **Common Statistical Measures**

<a id="definition-of-common-statistical-measures"></a>
### Definition of Common Statistical Measures

* **Mean:** The average of a set of numbers.
* **Median:** The middle value in a sorted list of numbers.
* **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.
* **Variance:** A measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.
* **Standard Deviation:** The square root of the variance, providing a measure of dispersion in the same units as the data.
* **Range:** The difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset.

## **Glossary**

<a id="definition-of-glossary"></a>
### Definition of Glossary

* **Definition:** An alphabetical list of terms in a particular domain of knowledge with the definitions for those terms. This section would typically contain all key terms defined throughout the document.
